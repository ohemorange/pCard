<p>We are a team of students who wanted an easy way to send Princeton-themed greeting cards to our friends and loved ones. After all, what better way to show your pride in Princeton than to send a holiday card to everyone you know with a beautiful image of Princeton in the background?</p>

<h2>Who are we?</h2>

<h3>Erica Portnoy</h3>
<p>Erica would rather get this site working than write something about herself. Interestingly, both then and than would have worked there. Also interestingly, she initally typed "Integer" instead of "Interest". And she just did it again. Maybe she should take more humanities classes and fewer math classes.</p>
