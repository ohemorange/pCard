- fill in different field on different pages (annoying to do, not necessary, but I figured out how to do it using routes.db now)
- add admin + random numbers and letters to routes.db to manually clean database (me)
- add users database + interface so people can save cards. this is a big, not-as-vital thing.
- prettify everything
- better header
- write an about page
- implement send (pal)
- show card on preview
- add a page for just viewing, same exact thing as show actually but just without the edit and send buttons (me)
- more designs (pal?)
- fill in backgrounds database with images (I can do this, but if you guys have others)
- domain name (pal)

migrate

- validate email addresses (I'll take care of this)
- stick a cancel button on the "new card" page that takes you back to the homepage (me)
